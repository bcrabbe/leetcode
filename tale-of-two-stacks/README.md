# Queues: A Tale of Two Stacks

In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then process queries, where each query is one of the following types:

1 x: Enqueue x into the queue.
2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
3: Print the element at the front of the queue.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, q, the number of queries.
Each of the q subsequent lines contains a query in the form described above.

Constraints

1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9

Output Format

For each query of type 3, print the value of the element at the front of the queue on a new line.
